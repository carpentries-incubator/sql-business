## Joins

To combine data from two tables we use the SQL `JOIN` command, which comes after
the `FROM` command.   

The `JOIN` command on its own will result in a cross product, where each row in
the first table is paired with each row in the second table. Usually this is not
what is desired when combining two tables with data that is related in some way.

An example of cross product: <br>
Not very helpful right? <br>
![cross product](../img/joinx.png){:height="300px"}

For that, we need to tell the computer which columns provide the link between the two
tables using the word `ON`.  What we want is to join the data with the same
item id. For example, try join the invoice_info and item_info table:  

    SELECT *
    FROM invoice_info
    JOIN item_info
    ON invoice_info.Item_id = item_info.Item_id;

`ON` is like `WHERE`, it filters things out according to a test condition.  We use
the `table.colname` format to tell the manager what column in which table we are
referring to.

The output of the `JOIN` command will have columns from the first table plus the
columns from the second table. For the above command, you will see two item_id columns. 

Alternatively, we can use the word `USING`, as a short-hand. `USING` only 
works on columns which share the same name. In this case we are
telling the manager that we want to combine `invoice_info` with `item_info` and that
the common column is `item_id`. 

    SELECT *
    FROM invoice_info
    JOIN item_info
    USING (item_id);

The output will only have one **item_id** column

We often won't want all of the fields from both tables, we can select the columns by using `table.colname`.

For example, what if we wanted only the invoice_id, Item_Description, Bottle_Volume_ml, Bottle_Retail_Price? 
Sometimes table names are very long, it is handy to give alias to table names.  

    SELECT inv.Invoice_id, ite.Item_Description, ite.Bottle_Volume_ml, ite.Bottle_Retail_Price
    FROM invoice_info AS inv
    JOIN item_info AS ite
    USING (item_id);

### Different join types
There are few types of joins:  
![join](../img/join.png){:height="500px"} <br>
An INNER JOIN is the most common and default type of join. You can use INNER keyword optionally.
<br>
We can count the number of records returned by a join query with store_info and county table.

    SELECT COUNT(*)
    FROM store_info
    INNER JOIN county
    USING(County_id);

Notice that this number is larger than left join.

    SELECT COUNT(*)
    FROM store_info
    LEFT JOIN county
    USING(County_id);

Remember: In SQL a `NULL` value in one table can never be joined to a `NULL` value in a
second table because `NULL` is not equal to anything, not even itself.
<br>
`CROSS JOIN` are not very often used, it returns weird things...
<br>
RIGHT JOIN and FULL OUTER JOIN is not supported in sqlite3 <br>
If you need to do RIGHT JOIN, you can just swap the table names  <br>
If you need to do FULL OUTER JOIN, you need to do two queries and use `UNION ALL` to put them together <br>
Suppose you have two tables, table A with attribute "ab" and "a", table B with attribute "ab" and "b", and the join column is "ab",   
```
SELECT *
FROM A
LEFT JOIN B USING(ab)
UNION ALL
SELECT *
FROM B
LEFT JOIN A USING(ab)
WHERE A.ab IS NULL; 
```
> ## Challenge:
> Think about this query, what does each SELECT statement do? How was the full outer join achieved?

>> ## Solution
>>
>> First select statement selects "in A but not in B" and "both in A and in B" <br> 
>> This is different from SELECT * FROM A; because it identifies what's in A but not in B <br>
>> Second select statement selects "in B but not in A" <br>

### Combining joins with sorting and aggregation

Ok, now we mash everything together. 
Lets try to see which stores have the most number of purchases in 2015. Number of purchases by a store is equal to number of invoices grouped by store_id. 
We want the Store_Name, Address, County_Name, number of invoices for each store in 2015, and then
sort the result by number of invoices at descending order. Try slowly build the query step by step. 

    SELECT st.Store_Name, st.Address, County_Name, count(invoice_id) AS Num_Invoice
    FROM store_info as st
    INNER JOIN County as ct 
    ON st.County_id = ct.County_id
    INNER JOIN invoice_info as inv
    ON st.Store_id = inv.Store_id
    WHERE strftime('%Y', Date)  == '2015'
    GROUP BY st.Store_id
    ORDER BY Num_Invoice DESC;

## Functions `IFNULL` and `NULLIF` and more

SQL includes numerous functions for manipulating data. You've already seen some
of these being used for aggregation (`SUM` and `COUNT`) but there are functions
that operate on individual values as well. Probably the most important of these
are `IFNULL` and `NULLIF`. `IFNULL` allows us to specify a value to use in
place of `NULL`.

Remember the ones that does not have a County_id? Let's replace the "None" with "Online"

    SELECT Store_id, Store_Name, IFNULL(County_id, "Online") AS County_id
    FROM store_info;

Keep in mind that this does not change the database, it is still just a query. So if you exclude the IFNULL, the query will still return None.
`IFNULL` can be particularly useful in `JOIN`. Even if there is no NULL value in any tables, sometimes a LEFT JOIN could result in NULL values.
Our database is very clean, so unfortunately, there are not much null values to play with...  

The inverse of `IFNULL` is `NULLIF`. This returns `NULL` if the first argument
is equal to the second argument. If the two are not equal, the first argument
is returned. This is useful for "nulling out" specific values.

Some more functions which are common to SQL databases are listed in the table
below:

| Function                     | Description                                                                                     |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ABS(n)`                     | Returns the absolute (positive) value of the numeric expression *n*                             |
| `LENGTH(s)`                  | Returns the length of the string expression *s*                                                 |
| `LOWER(s)`                   | Returns the string expression *s* converted to lowercase                                        |
| `NULLIF(x, y)`               | Returns NULL if *x* is equal to *y*, otherwise returns *x*                                      |
| `ROUND(n)` or `ROUND(n, x)`  | Returns the numeric expression *n* rounded to *x* digits after the decimal point (0 by default) |
| `TRIM(s)`                    | Returns the string expression *s* without leading and trailing whitespace characters            |
| `UPPER(s)`                   | Returns the string expression *s* converted to uppercase                                        |

Finally, some useful functions which are particular to SQLite are listed in the
table below:

| Function                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                    |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `IFNULL(x, y)`                      | Returns *x* if it is non-NULL, otherwise returns *y*                                                                                                                           |
| `RANDOM()`                          | Returns a random integer between -9223372036854775808 and +9223372036854775807.                                                                                                |
| `REPLACE(s, f, r)`                  | Returns the string expression *s* in which every occurrence of *f* has been replaced with *r*                                                                                  |
| `SUBSTR(s, x, y)` or `SUBSTR(s, x)` | Returns the portion of the string expression *s* starting at the character position *x* (leftmost position is 1), *y* characters long (or to the end of *s* if *y* is omitted) |
