> ## Software
> SQL is a specialized programming language used with databases.  We
> use a simple database manager called [sqlite3](https://docs.python.org/2/library/sqlite3.html) in python for this workshop.
> 
> We will use jupyter notebook to run python. If you have not installed jupyter notebooks, please follow the instructions to install. For both windows and Mac, the easiest way is to install [ANACODA](https://www.anaconda.com/download) (recommend download and install the python 3.6 version). ANACODA will automatically install python, jupyter and few packages that are frequently used in data analytics to your computer. You can also choose to use `python3 -m pip install jupyter` command to install if you already have python in your computer. 
> 
> After installing ANACODA or jupyter notebook, 
> ### Windows 
> - Create a new folder on your desktop called "sql_workshop"   
> - go to "Start" or the windows button on your desktop, type "anacoda prompt" in your search bar, click "anacoda prompt".
> - Type `cd desktop` and hit enter (this will go to your desktop. You can use other directory as well)
> - Type `cd sql_workshop` and hit enter to go to the folder you just created  
> - Type `jupyter notebook` to open the notebook! It will automatically open your browser. If not, copy the link that shows up on the terminal and paste it into your browser. 
> 
> ### Macs  
> - go to "Go" -> "Utilities" -> "Terminal"  
> - Now we will make a folder for the workshop: 
> - Type `cd Desktop` and hit enter (this will go to your desktop. You can use other directory by typing "cd directory_name" as well)
> - Type `mkdir sql_workshop` and hit enter (this will create an folder named "sql_workshop" on your desktop, you can change the name if you want)
> - Type `cd sql_workshop` and hit enter to go to the folder you just created  
> - Type `jupyter notebook` to open the notebook! It will automatically open your browser. If not, copy the link that shows up on the terminal and paste it into your browser. 
> 
> **Now you successfully have the notebook open!**
