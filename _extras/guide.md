## Learning objectives
* Understand concept of relational database
* Be able to perform simple queries in SQL from a single table
* Understand how to filter and sort results from a query
* Use aggregate functions to combine data
* Perform queries across tables

## Data
As for all of the [SQL for business lessons](https://github.com/data-lessons/SQL-business), this
lesson uses the data.iowa.gov database. The original data is available at https://data.iowa.gov/Economy/Iowa-Liquor-Sales/m3tr-qhgy, the modified database we use for this workshop is avaliable at https://github.com/data-lessons/SQL-business/tree/gh-pages/data
It is named as `soda.db`, it can be imported into SQLite.

## Motivation and Framing

See this slide deck as a sample intro for the lesson: 
[SQL Intro Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/christinalk/data-carpentry-sql-introduction)

Key points: 
* Want to query data, instead of editing directly
* Need a solution that is scalable and reproducible
* Introduce the typical ways of dealing with rectangular data (subsetting, 
split-apply-combine)

If you've written up a diagram of the data analysis pipeline (raw data -> 
clean data -> import and analyze -> results -> visualization), it can be 
helpful to identify that you're now somewhere between clean data and analysis.  

You can also describe few scenario when SQL was used in business environment. For example, auditors often have to access clients' database. 

## Lesson outline

### 00-sql-introduction
* Show what might be a problem to store data in Excel (scalability, redundancy, update error)
* Introduce relational databases, database management systems, SQLite
* Explain Primary Keys and Foreign Keys  

### 00-supplement-database-design.md
(optional)
The first lesson includes a brief introduction to data design and choosing database systems. This material expands on the database design in the first section.

### 01-sql-data
* Download data, import data  
* Show how to show query output
* Talk about what data are in the database 
* Explain the relationship between tables with the digram  
* Discuss different datatypes 

### 02-sql-basic-queries
* Write basic queries using SELECT and FROM
* Filter results using DISTINCT, WHERE
* Change how results are displayed using ORDER BY and by doing calculations on results

### 03-sql-aggregation
* Combine results using COUNT and GROUP BY
* Filtering based on aggregation with HAVING
* Saving queries using VIEW
* Dealing with NULL  

### 04-sql-joins
* combining data from two tables using JOIN, ON, USING
* depending on time, could introduce different types of JOINs
* using aliases with AS to simplify queries
* Talk about subqueries
* When query getting complex, show students how to slowly build up the query by parts  

## Alternative activities

### Queries on the board

As you teach the lesson, it can be helpful to pause and write up the query keywords 
on the board.  This could look like this: 

* After 01-sql-basic queries
~~~
SELECT column
       FUNCTION(column)
       
FROM table

WHERE (conditional statement, applies to row values) 
      (AND/OR) 
      

   
ORDER BY column/FUNCTION(column) (ASC/DESC)
~~~

* After 02-sql-aggregation
~~~
SELECT column
       FUNCTION(column)
       AGGREGATE_FUNCTION(column)
FROM table

WHERE (conditional statement, applies to row values) 
      (AND/OR) 
      (IS (NOT) NULL)
GROUP BY column
   HAVING (conditional statement, applies to group)
ORDER BY column/FUNCTION(column) (ASC/DESC)
~~~

* After 03-sql-joins-aliases
~~~
SELECT column
       FUNCTION(column)
       AGGREGATE_FUNCTION(column)
FROM table
JOIN table ON table.col = table.col
WHERE (conditional statement, applies to row values) 
      (AND/OR) 
      (IS (NOT) NULL)
GROUP BY column
   HAVING (conditional statement, applies to group)
ORDER BY column/FUNCTION(column) (ASC/DESC)
~~~

As a bonus, if you can leave this on the board, it translates nicely into 
the `dplyr` portion of the `R` lesson, i.e.: 

~~~
SQL:                                                 dplyr: 

SELECT column                                        select(col)
       FUNCTION(column)                              mutate(col = fcn(col))
       AGGREGATE_FUNCTION(column)                    summarize(col = fcn(col))
FROM table
JOIN table ON table.col = table.col
WHERE (conditional statement, applies to row values) filter(condition)
      (AND/OR) 
      (IS (NOT) NULL)                                is.na()
GROUP BY column                                      group_by(col)
   HAVING (conditional statement, applies to group)
ORDER BY column/FUNCTION(column) (ASC/DESC)          arrange()
~~~

### "Interactive" database

If you want to try something more active (esp. if you're teaching SQL in the 
afternoon!), this is a an interactive activity to try.  

* Give each student six cards, with the following labels: 
	* name
	* name
	* height
	* DoC
	* height*2.54
	* dept
* Have students fill out their cards: 
	* Name: first name
	* Height: height in INCHES
	* Dept (department): close enough (just pick one if you donâ€™t have a home department)
	* DoC (Dog or Cat): Dog, Cat, Both, Neither, or leave blank
* Each student is now a *record* in an interactive "students" database, where 
each of the cards they hold is a *field* in that database.  
* At various points in the lesson, stop and "query" the student database.  To do this: 
	* On a slide (or in a text editor), show or type in a sample query.  Something like: 
    ~~~
    SELECT name, name FROM students WHERE height > 66
    ~~~
	* If the query applies to a record (student), that student should stand, 
	and display (hold up) the appropriate field (card)
	* See the following slide deck for a list of sample queries.  [Sample queries](https://speakerdeck.com/christinalk/query-live-database)
